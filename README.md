After unpacking the zip you will see a `run.cmd`, a `run.sh`, `server.js`, `package.json`, `index.html`, and a `<course-folder>` with the name of the course you are taking.

* The `run.sh` and `run.cmd` are scripts to start the course. And allow viewing from your browser at http://localhost:3000

* The `package.json` and the `server.js` are used to create a simple server to serve the static assets starting with the `index.html`.

* Any provided applications used during the course can be found in `<course-folder>/resources/demo-apps/`
